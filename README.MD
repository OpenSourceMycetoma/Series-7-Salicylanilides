<h1>Series 7: Salicylanilide antifungal agents</h1>

Screening of the [Oncode drug repurposing library](https://www.oncodeinstitute.nl/drug-repurposing-programme) identified the compound [IMD-0354](https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaf369) as having good activity against *M. mycetomatis*. [1] It was then noted that other salicylanilides had shown activity in past screenings, including the World Health Organzation essential medicine [niclosamide](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26134005) (used to treat tapeworms), MMV665807 from the Medicines for Malaria Venture Open Source Box and [MMV687807](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006437) from the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box. [2] and [3] 

Analogues of these salicylanilide compounds are now being synthesised by students at the University of Sydney, Australia (under direction of Dr Shane Wilkinson) and the University of York, UK (under direction of Dr Peter Rayner).
